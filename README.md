# Contacts (Kotlin) Project

Welcome to the Contacts (Kotlin) project! This project is designed to help you manage your contacts efficiently, similar to a mobile phone contacts app. It is a part of the Hyperskill learning platform, where you can learn and implement the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Kotlin.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create a program that can store information about both people and organizations. The application allows you to search for contacts by name and manage your contact list effectively.

### Key Features

- **Contact Management**: Create, update, and remove contacts.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for people or organizations by name.
- **Inheritance**: Use inheritance to handle different types of contacts (people and organizations).
- **OOP Principles**: Implement classes and inheritance to manage contact information.

### Project Structure

- **Person and Organization Classes**: The project uses a base class to store common information like phone numbers. Two classes inherit from this base class: one for people and another for organizations.
- **Record List**: The list of records contains elements of the base class, allowing it to store both people and organizations.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open it in your preferred IDE. Ensure you have Kotlin installed and configured.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
This is the *Contacts (Kotlin)* project I made myself.
